This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) for Profico's DUMP Internship React Rendering Patterns presentation.

## Getting Started

Build the application using:

```
npm run build
```
and start using
```
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Compare different rendering approaches

There are three buttons to display the same news homepage.
Use them to see a comparison of rendering modes:
- `/client` displays a CSR page with data fetching on the client
- `/server` displays an SSR page with data fetching on the server
- `/static` display a statically generated page

## Use it as a playground

Run the development server using

```
npm run dev
```
or
```
npm run dev --turbo
```
